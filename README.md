## EXERCISE 2: 6) Satellite Command System Programming Exercise

**Satellite Command System  simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default
initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.**

**Classes:**

**ActivatePanelsCommand**

**CollectDataCommand**

**DeactivatePanelsCommand**

**RotateCommand**

**SatelliteCommandSystem uses Invoker (Command Pattern)**

**Satellite uses Receiver (Command Pattern)**

**Interface:**

**Command**

**Pattern Used: Command Pattern**

## Features

**Orientation**

**Activate and Deactivate Panels**

**Collectdata**

### Orientation( rotate(South) would set the orientation to "South"
