# SatelliteCommandSystem
This is a project about Satellite Command System
## EXERCISE 1 - Problem Statement on Design patterns
  **Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.**
  
  **Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern.**
  
  **Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.**

## EXERCISE 2: 6) Satellite Command System Programming Exercise

**Satellite Command System  simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default
initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.**

**Classes:
**ActivatePanelsCommand
** CollectDataCommand
** DeactivatePanelsCommand
** RotateCommand
**SatelliteCommandSystem uses Invoker (Command Pattern)
**Satellite uses Receiver (Command Pattern)

**Interface
**Command
